# Medical Image Classification Using Bag of Words

1. An algorithm trained and tested for classifying different medical X-ray images using the concept of machine learning and taking advantage of the bag of words model. 

2. Data was a set of X-ray images with labels attached to it. It was analyzed in detail initially. 

3. The data was pre processed using noise removal technique and took advantage of the adaptive filtering technique. 

4. The feature was extracted using SURF algorithm and the common feature were clustered using K-means algorithm.

5. A histogram was generated for the different features and was saved which was called the "histogram book".

6. With the help of the histogram, the images were trained using supervised machine learning technique taking advantage of the support vector machine algorithm

7. The images were then tested and produced an accuracy result of 87%.
